description: Design pattern for LLM-as-judge evaluators — binary checks as evidence, one named holistic verdict, no score aggregation. Use when designing or reviewing any LLM-based quality gate, evaluator, judge prompt, or verdict schema; when a judge's rubric scores fluctuate between runs; when you catch yourself asking an LLM for a 1-5 score, averaging check results, or thresholding a satisfaction ratio. NOT for choosing whether a task belongs to code or LLM (that is when-code-when-llm) and NOT for the architecture-level judge+enforce state-mutation split (that is code-and-llm-collaboration).

# LLM-as-Judge — Checks as Evidence, Holistic Verdict, No Scores

Core rule in one line:

> **Collect evidence with binary Yes/No checks, let the LLM issue one named
> holistic verdict, and never aggregate the answers into a score.**

## Why not rubric scores

- **Irreproducible.** Numeric scores on the same input drift between runs (3 vs 4
  out of 5). LLMs are bad at independent per-dimension scoring — they get pulled
  by the overall impression, and central-tendency bias compresses scores into a
  narrow band that straddles any threshold you pick.
- **Dilution.** A sum or satisfaction ratio converts one fatal defect ("the
  referenced file does not exist") into a small deduction. One dominant No must
  be able to decide the outcome alone.
- **Unexplainable.** Nobody can say why something is a 3.5. A No answer to a
  concrete question explains itself and doubles as the improvement item.

Rubrics were invented to structure *human* evaluation, where assessors can score
dimensions independently. For an LLM, invert the design: force the checks it
tends to skip, and leave the judgment holistic — that is what it is good at.

## The three principles

| Principle | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| ① Binary checks | Decompose criteria into Yes/No questions with 1-line evidence each | "Rate specificity 1–5" |
| ② Named holistic verdict | Pick exactly one verdict from a fixed enum, judging the whole | "Total 12 points → pass" |
| ③ No aggregation | Enumerate the No answers as the verdict's rationale | Use the Yes-ratio as a quality metric |

### ① Binary checks

Ask "is there a runnable command example? Yes/No", not "how specific is this?".
Good binary questions are **verifiable** (the text settles them black-or-white)
and **evidentiary** (a No names what is missing). Require one line of evidence
per answer — a file read, a path check, a measured command output.

### ② Named holistic verdict

Holistic judgment — one conclusion from the whole, without passing through
per-dimension numbers — is the LLM's strength. Design the verdict enum so each
value maps **1:1 to a next action**, e.g.:

- Library audit: `Keep / Improve / Update / Retire / Merge into [X]`
- Save-or-drop gate: `Save / Improve then Save / Absorb into [X] / Drop`

Prefer this over bare `accept / reject`: downstream code can dispatch on the
enum directly. Verdicts that name a target (`Merge into [X]`, `Absorb into [X]`)
structurally forbid vague judgments like "overlaps with something".

### ③ No aggregation

Two rules replace the score:

1. **Enumerate every No** in the verdict rationale (hidden Nos breed verdict
   drift between runs).
2. **A dominant No decides alone.** If a fatal-class question is No (nonexistent
   reference, ungrounded claim), lean to the failing verdict even when
   everything else is Yes. Never let averaging dilute it.

## Verdict pressure-test

Before finalizing a non-passing draft verdict, make the judge attack it:

1. Generate 1–3 **atomic** Yes/No questions that try to **refute** the draft
   verdict (e.g. draft = "Update: CLI flag retired" → "does the flag still
   appear in current `--help` output? measure it").
2. Answer each with one line of evidence.
3. Refutation holds → fall back toward the passing verdict.
4. Defect confirmed → the binary-screen No answers become the improvement list
   as-is.

Discipline: one question tests exactly one verifiable claim (atomicity);
questions seek disconfirmation, not affirmation. After a fix, **re-judge with
the same question set, once only** — regenerating questions makes it impossible
to tell whether the fix worked or the bar moved.

## Scale the machinery, not the principles

| | Single-draft gate (N=1) | Library-scale audit (tens of items) |
|---|---|---|
| Pressure-test questions | Unconditional, 3–5 per draft | Non-passing candidates only, 1–3 |
| Rationale | Cost is negligible | Generating for every item is mostly waste |

## Don't let deterministic checks ride on judgment

The judge's attention is a diluting resource. A controlled comparison on a
73-item skill library (2026-07) made this concrete: an everything-in-one-context
pass returned all-Keep, while fresh-context small batches with **unconditional**
reference verification surfaced 12/73 non-passing items — half with
deterministic evidence (404 links, deleted files, retired CLI flags), including
passing verdicts previously issued for two files that did not exist on disk.
A dedicated overlap probe reproduced the set-level view (0 genuine duplications
across 17 candidate clusters) without needing all bodies in one context.

Design consequences:

- **Existence before judgment.** Deterministically checkable claims (paths
  exist, flags current, URLs live) get code-owned, unconditional pre-checks —
  `ls`, `--help`, fetch — before the LLM sees the item. Never let a judge issue
  a passing verdict on a file that is not there.
- **Conditional verification triggers degrade.** "Verify if it looks stale" is
  banned phrasing: the trigger itself is a diluting judgment, and in a loaded
  context it decays to "never verify".
- **Narrow, dense contexts for per-item judgment; light sweeps for set-level
  judgment.** Split by the property being checked, not by context length.
- Before handing anything to the judge, ask: *is this actually judgment, or is
  it `ls`?*

## Judge prompt template

```markdown
You are a quality evaluator for {artifact type}. Evaluate as follows.

## Step 1: Binary checks (all mandatory)
Answer each with Yes/No plus one line of evidence.
- Q1: {verifiable question, e.g. is there a runnable code example?}
- Q2: {verifiable question}
- Q3: {verifiable question}
- Q4: {verifiable question}

## Step 2: Item-specific refutation questions (only if the draft verdict leans failing)
Pick one draft verdict, generate 1–3 Yes/No questions that try to refute it,
and answer each with one line of evidence.

## Step 3: Verdict
Choose exactly one. Output no scores or points.
- {verdict_1}: {meaning and next action}
- {verdict_2}: {meaning and next action}
- {verdict_3}: {meaning and next action}

Enumerate every No-answered question in the rationale.
If any dominant No ({domain-specific fatal condition}) is present, choose
{failing verdict} even when everything else is Yes.

## Output format
Follow the JSON schema below and output **JSON only**
(no surrounding prose or Markdown).
```

Output schema:

```json
{
  "verdict": "Improve",
  "evidence": [
    { "question": "Runnable code example?", "answer": "No", "detail": "steps are prose-only, zero commands" },
    { "question": "Referenced paths exist?", "answer": "Yes", "detail": "ls confirmed all 3 paths" }
  ],
  "pressure_test": [
    { "question": "Are prose-only steps reproducible as-is?", "answer": "No", "detail": "step 3's arguments are ambiguous" }
  ],
  "reason": "Dominant No on actionability; adding a worked example to step 3 would reach the passing bar"
}
```

`verdict` is an enum — downstream code dispatches on it directly; the No items
in `evidence` are the improvement list handed to the next stage.
